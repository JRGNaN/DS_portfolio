# Joquín Rodrigo García - Data Science Portfolio

## About portfolio
Projects, practices, examples of my passion: Data Science  

Below some examples as a showcase of my skills and work during my Master in Data Science at Immune Technology Institute and self-learning projects. 
I hope it could be useful and of your interest.

## Projects

### KMeans: Customer Segmentation
_Code_: [ML_U_KMeans_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb](/ML_Unsupervised/KMeans/)  
_Description_: It was clustered a dataset of 200 customer profiles using the KMeans algorithm, which were described by 5 variables (ID, sex, income, score, and age), into a minimum number of groups.

### SVM: Heart Abnormality for Defibrillator
_Code_: [ML_S_SVM_Heart_Abnormality_Defibrillator.ipynb](/ML_Supervised/SVM/)  
_Description_: Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are electronic devices commonly used to treat certain types of arrhythmias. These devices are equipped with a predictive classification algorithm that detects whether or not there is any cardiac anomaly. It was used Support Vector Machine for classify a ventricular fibrillation correctly.

### Decision Tree Classifier: Top-Selling Shops
_Code_: [ML_S_Decision_Tree_Top-Selling_Shops.ipynb](/ML_Supervised/DecisionTreeClassifier/)  
_Description_: using a Decision Tree Classifier model, top-selling shops were grouped according to their profile as determined by population, shop and product variables.

### Decision Tree Regressor: Property Prices
_Code_: [ML_S_Decision_Tree_Regressor_Property Prices.ipynb](/ML_Supervised/DecisionTreeRegressor/)  
_Description_: model for property prediction in California, using Decision Tree Regressor.
