# Joquín Rodrigo García - Data Science Portfolio

## About portfolio
Projects, practices, examples of my passion: Data Science  

Below some examples as a showcase of my skills and work during my Master in Data Science at Immune Technology Institute and self-learning projects. 
I hope it could be useful and of your interest.

## Projects

### KMeans: Customer Segmentation
_Code_: [ML_U_KMeans_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb](/ML_Unsupervised/KMeans/)  
_Description_: It was clustered a dataset of 200 customer profiles using the KMeans algorithm, which were described by 5 variables (ID, sex, income, score, and age), into a minimum number of groups.

### DBSCAN: Customer Segmentation
_Code_: [ML_U_DBSCAN_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb](/ML_Unsupervised/DSBCAN/)  
_Description_: dataset corresponds to data from a supermarket, which, through loyalty cards, has data on its customers, such as customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score, which is something it assigns to the customer based on its defined parameters such as customer behaviour and purchase data. Let's make a customer segmentation with DBSCAN model.

### Isolation Forest: Bank Fraud
_Code_: [ML_U_Isolation_Forest_Bank_Fraud.ipynb](/ML_Unsupervised/IsolationForest/)  
_Description_: let's work on an example of banking fraud, which contains data on customers who have applied for a loan from the bank. 

### Apriori: Shopping Basket Analysis
_Code_: [ML_U_Apriori_Shopping_Basket.ipynb](/ML_Unsupervised/Apriori/)  
_Description_: from a dataset with 38.765 rows of grocery shop purchase we are going to perform a shopping basket analysis with the Apriori algorithm.

### SVM: Heart Abnormality for Defibrillator
_Code_: [ML_S_SVM_Heart_Abnormality_Defibrillator.ipynb](/ML_Supervised/SVM/)  
_Description_: Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are electronic devices commonly used to treat certain types of arrhythmias. These devices are equipped with a predictive classification algorithm that detects whether or not there is any cardiac anomaly. It was used Support Vector Machine for classify a ventricular fibrillation correctly.

### Decision Tree Classifier: Top-Selling Shops
_Code_: [ML_S_Decision_Tree_Top-Selling_Shops.ipynb](/ML_Supervised/DecisionTreeClassifier/)  
_Description_: using a Decision Tree Classifier model, top-selling shops were grouped according to their profile as determined by population, shop and product variables.

### Decision Tree Regressor: Property Prices
_Code_: [ML_S_Decision_Tree_Regressor_Property Prices.ipynb](/ML_Supervised/DecisionTreeRegressor/)  
_Description_: model for property prediction in California, using Decision Tree Regressor.

### Random Forest: Top-Selling Shops
_Code_: [ML_S_Ensemble_Random_Forest_Classifier_Top-Selling_Shops.ipynb](/ML_Supervised/RandomForest/)  
_Description_: using a Random Forest, a kind of Ensemble model, top-selling shops were grouped according to their profile as determined by population, shop and product variables.
